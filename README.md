# 2D_RPG_Multiplayer

https://pkcody.github.io/2D_RPG_Multiplayer/

Based on a multiplayer 2D RPG using Unity, Photn, and Tiled. Then created a menu and lobby system. Also, made a layer controller that could move, attack, die, respawn, and collect pickups.

I added my own tiled map, along with the theme of whoever is the richest (or kills enemys to gain money) would win the game. So I adjusted code to achieve the goal.
